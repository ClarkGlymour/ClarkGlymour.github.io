Their results are disappointing: no method reliably finds and directs connections without large false negatives, large false positives, or both. Using multiple subject inputs, we apply a previously published search algorithm, IMaGES, and novel orientation algorithms, LOFS, in tandem to all of the simulations of DCM models described by Smith et al.

We find that the procedures accurately identify effective connections in almost all of the conditions that Smith et al. simulated and, in most conditions, direct causal connections with precision greater than 90% and recall greater than 80%.",

		"abstract": "We consider several alternative ways of exploiting non-Gaussian distributional features, including some that can in principle identify direct, positive feedback relations (graphically, 2-cycles) and combinations of methods that can identify high dimensional graphs. All of the procedures are implemented in the TETRAD freeware (Ramsey et al., 2013). We show that in most cases the limited accuracy of the several non-Gaussian methods in the Smith et al. (2011) simulations can be attributed to the high-pass Butterworth filter used in that study. Without that filter, or with the filter in the widely used FSL program (Jenkinson et al., 2012), the directional accuracies of several of the non-Gaussian methods are at or near ceiling in many conditions of the Smith et al. simulation. We show that the improvement of an apparently Gaussian method (Patel et al., 2006) when filtering is removed is due to non-Gaussian features of that method introduced by the Smith et al. implementation. We also investigate some conditions in which multi-subject data help with causal structure identification using higher moments, notably with non-stationary time series or with 2-cycles. We illustrate the accuracy of the methods with more complex graphs with and without 2-cycles, and with a 500 node graph; to illustrate applicability and provide a further test we apply the methods to an empirical case for which aspects of the causal structure are known. Finally, we note a number of cautions and issues that remain to be investigated, and some outstanding problems for determining the structure of effective connections from fMRI data.",

		"abstract": "Neumann et al. (2010) aim to find directed graphical representations of the independence and dependence relations among activities in brain regions by applying a search procedure to merged fMRI activity records from a large number of contrasts obtained under a variety of conditions. To that end, Neumann et al., obtain three graphical models, justifying their search procedure with simulations that find that merging the data sampled from probability distributions characterized by two distinct Bayes net graphs results in a graphical object that combines the edges in the individual graphs. We argue that the graphical objects they obtain cannot be interpreted as representations of conditional independence and dependence relations among localized neural activities; specifically, directed edges and directed pathways in their graphical results may be artifacts of the manner in which separate studies are combined in the meta-analytic procedure. With a larger simulation study, we argue that their simulation results with combined data sets are an artifact of their choice of examples. We provide sufficient conditions and necessary conditions for the merger of two or more probability distributions, each characterized by the Markov equivalence class of a directed acyclic graph, to be describable by a Markov equivalence class whose edges are a union of those for the individual distributions. Contrary to Neumann et al., we argue that the scientific value of searches for network representations from imaging data lies in attempting to characterize large scaled neural mechanisms, and we suggest several alternative strategies for combining data from multiple experiments.",

We compare an adaptation of the first correct method for recovering cyclic linear systems; Granger causal regression; a multivariate autoregressive model with a permutation test; the Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME) algorithm; the Ramsey et al. non-Gaussian methods; two non-Gaussian methods by Hyvärinen and Smith; a method due to Patel et al.; and the GlobalMIT algorithm. We introduce and also compare two new methods, Fast Adjacency Skewness (FASK) and Two-Step, both of which exploit non-Gaussian features of the BOLD signal. We give theoretical justifications for the latter two algorithms. Our test models include feedback structures with and without direct feedback (2-cycles), excitatory and inhibitory feedback, models using experimentally determined structural connectivities of macaques, and empirical human resting-state and task data. We find that averaged over all of our simulations, including those with 2-cycles, several of these methods have a better than 80% orientation precision (i.e., the probability of a directed edge is in the true structure given that a procedure estimates it to be so) and the two new methods also have better than 80% recall (probability of recovering an orientation in the true structure).",

		"abstract": "Neuroimaging (e.g. fMRI) data are increasingly used to attempt to identify not only brain regions of interest (ROIs) that are especially active during perception, cognition, and action, but also the qualitative causal relations among activity in these regions (known as effective connectivity; Friston, 1994). Previous investigations and anatomical and physiological knowledge may somewhat constrain the possible hypotheses, but there often remains a vast space of possible causal structures. To find actual effective connectivity relations, search methods must accommodate indirect measurements of nonlinear time series dependencies, feedback, multiple subjects possibly varying in identified regions of interest, and unknown possible location-dependent variations in BOLD response delays. We describe combinations of procedures that under these conditions find feed-forward sub-structure characteristic of a group of subjects. The method is illustrated with an empirical data set and confirmed with simulations of time series of non-linear, randomly generated, effective connectivities, with feedback, subject to random differences of BOLD delays, with regions of interest missing at random for some subjects, measured with noise approximating the signal to noise ratio of the empirical data.",

What is meant by ‘mechanism’ is rarely specified in this literature, but the examples given make it relatively clear that to specify a ‘mechanism’ for a covariation is simply to specify either a sequence of causes that intervene between the candidate cause and effect, or causes that tend to bring about both the candidate cause and effect, where the causal connections posited in the ‘mechanism’ are of a kind that are already familiar and acknowledged.

		"abstract": "One January a few years ago, shortly after the governor of Arizona had been impeached and the Exxon Valdez had spilled its cargo around Port Arthur, I had one of those uncanny experiences reserved for the people who read old news. Paging through the San Jose Mercury for January 1917, I came upon an article describing the impeachment of the governor of Arizona and a report of a large oil spill at Valdez, Alaska. Nietzche, it seems, was on to something, the Eternal Return, the no news under the sun, the history repeats itself sort of thing. I have had similarly uncanny experiences over the last few years reading bits of the literature of cognitive science as it has emerged in our time, and reading in the same years the literature of physiology, psychology, and psychiatry in the closing years of the 19th century. The parallelism is nowhere more striking than with the views of Kinsbourne and Farah (this volume).",

		"abstract": "Contemporary cognitive neuropsychology attempts to infer unobserved features of normal human cognition, or ‘cognitive architecture’, from experiments with normals and with brain-damaged subjects in whom certain normal cognitive capacities are altered, diminished, or absent. Fundamental methodological issues about the enterprise of cognitive neuropsychology concern the characterization of methods by which features of normal cognitive architecture can be identified from such data, the assumptions upon which the reliability of such methods are premised, and the limits of such methods—even granting their assumptions—in resolving uncertainties about that architecture. With some idealization, the question of the capacities of various experimental designs in cognitive neuropsychology to uncover cognitive architecture can be reduced to comparatively simple questions about the prior assumptions investigators are willing to make. This paper presents some of simplest of those reductions.",

		"abstract": "I argue that psychologists interested in human causal judgment should understand and adopt a representation of causal mechanisms by directed graphs that encode conditional independence (screening off) relations. I illustrate the benefits of that representation, now widely used in computer science and increasingly in statistics, by (i) showing that a dispute in psychology between ‘mechanist’ and ‘associationist’ psychological theories of causation rests on a false and confused dichotomy; (ii) showing that a recent, much-cited experiment, purporting to show that human subjects, incorrectly let large causes ‘overshadow’ small causes, misrepresents the most likely, and warranted, causal explanation available to the subjects, in the light of which their responses were normative; (iii) showing how a recent psychological theory (due to P. Cheng) of human judgment of causal power can be considerably generalized: and (iv) suggesting a range of possible experiments comparing human and computer abilities to extract causal information from associations.",

		"abstract": "This chapter offers a brief historical survey of attempts to fathom the physical mechanisms of mind as computational systems, followed by a consideration of some of the concrete versions of underdetermination in contemporary neuropsychology. In the conception of Hermann Helmholtz and his associates, Ernst Brucke and Emil du Bois Reymond and their students, mental phenomena were ultimately a piece of physiology, like breathing, and the ambition of psychology should be to unravel their physical mechanisms, as with any other physiological process. The work of Ramon y Cajal invited the view of the functioning brain as a kind of signaling system, what we would, but they did not, call a computational information processing system. What was needed to reduce structural underdetermination and allow the kind of theory of mind Helmholtz envisioned was a way to see inside the box, to acquire data that would bring theories of cognition closer to physiology and to the neural mechanisms of computation.",
