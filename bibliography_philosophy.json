		"abstract": "There are at least two aspects to understanding: comprehensibility and veracity. Good explanations are supposed to aid the first and to give grounds for believing the second – to provide insight into the “hidden springs” that produce phenomena and to warrant that our estimates of such structures are correct enough. For Copernicus, Kepler, Newton, Dalton, and Einstein, the virtues of explanations were guides to discovery, to sorting among hypotheses and forming beliefs. The virtues were variously named: simplicity, harmony, unity, elegance, and determinacy. These explanatory virtues have never been well articulated, but what makes them contributions to perspicacity is sometimes apparent, while what makes them a guide to truth is obscure.We know that under various assumptions there is a connection between testing – doing something that could reveal the falsity of various claims – and the second aspect of coming to understand. Various forms of testing can be stages in strategies that reliably converge on the truth, and some cases even provide probabilistic guarantees that the truth is not too far away. But how can explaining be any kind of reliable guide to any truth worth knowing? What structure or content of thoughts or acts distinguishes explanations, and in virtue of what, if anything, are explanations indications of truth that should prompt belief in their content, or provide a guide in inquiry?",

		"abstract": "Reichenbach states that an inductive logic cannot be built up entirely from logical principles independent of experience, but must develop out of the reasoning practiced and useful to the natural sciences. Inductive inference system needs to be built on some solid to guide scientific methodology. This chapter describes Reichenbach's reasons for stating the inverse approach for inductive logic. Instead of “a priori” foundation of inductive logic, Reichenbach's approach to induction is largely axiomatic. Reichenbach distinguishes deductive and mathematical logic from inductive logic. The former deals with the relations among tautologies, whereas the latter deals with truth in the sense of truth in reality. Deductive and mathematical logic are built on an axiomatic system. In contrast to the formal relations that are of interest in deductive logic, inductive logic is concerned with the determination of whether various relations among quantities are true in the world.",

		"abstract": "Time series of macroscopic quantities that are aggregates of microscopic quantities, with unknown one-many relations between macroscopic and microscopic states, are common in applied sciences, from economics to climate studies. When such time series of macroscopic quantities are claimed to be causal, the causal relations postulated are representable by a directed acyclic graph and associated probability distribution—sometimes called a dynamical Bayes net. Causal interpretations of such series imply claims that hypothetical manipulations of macroscopic variables have unambiguous effects on variables “downstream” in the graph, and such macroscopic variables may be predictably produced or altered even while particular microstates are not. This paper argues that such causal time series of macroscopic aggregates of microscopic processes are the appropriate model for mental causation.",

We argue that no relevant problem of the sort Fitelson supposes arises since his main theorem and his supporting arguments presuppose the validity of nonlinear transformations of credence functions that Joyce's theory, charitably construed, would identify as invalid on the basis of the principle of simple dominance.",

In each case, a probabilistic relation between a theory and data is said to measure the power of an explanation, or degree of unification, or degree of coherence. This essay argues that the measures do not capture cases that are paradigms of scientific explanation, that the available psychological evidence indicates that the measures do not capture judgements of explanatory power, and, finally, that the measures do not provide useful methods for selecting hypotheses.",

Many philosophers of science (following Nagel) have held that the apparently ontological issues involved in reduction should be replaced by analyses of the syntactic and semantic connections involved in explaining one theory on the basis of another. The replacement does not seem to have been especially successful, for we still lack a plausible account of inter-theoretical explanation. I attempt to provide one.",
