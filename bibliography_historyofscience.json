From the beginning, astronomy has combined mathematical idealization, technological ingenuity, and indefatigable data collection\nwith procedures to search through assembled data for the processes that govern the cosmos.\nAstronomers are, and ever have been, data miners, and for that reason astronomical methods\n(but not astronomical discoveries) have often been despised by statisticians and philosophers. Epithets laced the statistical literature: Ransacking! Data dredging! Double Counting!\nStatistical disdain was usually directed at social scientists and biologists, rarely if ever\nat astronomers, but the methodological attitudes and goals that many twentieth-century\nphilosophers and statisticians rejected were creations of the astronomical tradition. Thephilosophical criticisms were earlier and more direct. In the shadow (or in Alexander Pope’s\nphrasing, the light) cast on nature in the eighteenth century by the Newtonian triumph,\nDavid Hume revived arguments from the ancient Greeks to challenge the very possibility of\ncoming to know what causes what. His conclusion was endorsed in the twentieth century by\nmany philosophers who found talk of causation unnecessary or unacceptably metaphysical,\nand absorbed by many statisticians as a general suspicion of causal claims, except possibly\nwhen they are founded on experimental manipulation. And yet in the hands of a mathematician, Thomas Bayes, and another mathematician and philosopher, Richard Price, Hume’s\nessays prompted the development of a new kind of statistics, the kind we now call“Bayesian.”",

		"abstract": "Einstein himself had a few words to say about the writing of the history of science. From the first of his famous conversations with Einstein, Robert Shankland relates: “Then he gave me his ideas on historical writing of science. ‘Nearly all historians of science are philologists and do not comprehend what physicists were aiming at, how they thought and wrestled with their problems… .’ The struggle with their:problems, their trying everything to find a solution which came at last often by very indirect means, is the correct picture.” (Shankland 1963, p. 50).Why should we take these words seriously? After all, Einstein was not an historian, and, unless we are to pose him as an authority on every topic, these comments represent but a personal opinion. This, however, is precisely why they should be taken seriously, if we are interested in the history of Einstein's own accomplishments.",
