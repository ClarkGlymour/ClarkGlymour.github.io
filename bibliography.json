		"abstract": "Artificial intelligence is philosophical explication turned into computer programs. Historically, what we think of as artificial intelligence arose by taking the explications provided by philosophers, and finding computable extensions and applications of them. Developments in artificial intelligence programming technology have tended to make the process of transforming certain sorts of philosophical explications into programs nearly automatic. Production rule systems, for example, exploit the ambiguity between conditional sentences and procedural rules, and permit one to turn theories consisting of a collection of conditionals into a simple program, with little explicit worry about control structure or algorithm design. Nowadays, most of the philosophical theories used in artificial intelligence are not taken from the philosophical literature directly, but that does not make them any the less philosophical. Computer science teaches us that there is more to philosophy than we might have thought, and it contains new and interesting philosophical contributions.",

From the beginning, astronomy has combined mathematical idealization, technological ingenuity, and indefatigable data collection\nwith procedures to search through assembled data for the processes that govern the cosmos.\nAstronomers are, and ever have been, data miners, and for that reason astronomical methods\n(but not astronomical discoveries) have often been despised by statisticians and philosophers. Epithets laced the statistical literature: Ransacking! Data dredging! Double Counting!\nStatistical disdain was usually directed at social scientists and biologists, rarely if ever\nat astronomers, but the methodological attitudes and goals that many twentieth-century\nphilosophers and statisticians rejected were creations of the astronomical tradition. Thephilosophical criticisms were earlier and more direct. In the shadow (or in Alexander Pope’s\nphrasing, the light) cast on nature in the eighteenth century by the Newtonian triumph,\nDavid Hume revived arguments from the ancient Greeks to challenge the very possibility of\ncoming to know what causes what. His conclusion was endorsed in the twentieth century by\nmany philosophers who found talk of causation unnecessary or unacceptably metaphysical,\nand absorbed by many statisticians as a general suspicion of causal claims, except possibly\nwhen they are founded on experimental manipulation. And yet in the hands of a mathematician, Thomas Bayes, and another mathematician and philosopher, Richard Price, Hume’s\nessays prompted the development of a new kind of statistics, the kind we now call“Bayesian.”",

		"abstract": "Recent literature in philosophy of science has addressed purported notions of explanatory virtues—‘explanatory power’, ‘unification’, and ‘coherence’. In each case, a probabilistic relation between a theory and data is said to measure the power of an explanation, or degree of unification, or degree of coherence. This essay argues that the measures do not capture cases that are paradigms of scientific explanation, that the available psychological evidence indicates that the measures do not capture judgements of explanatory power, and, finally, that the measures do not provide useful methods for selecting hypotheses.",
