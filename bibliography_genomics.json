		"abstract": "We present evidence of a potentially serious source of error intrinsic to all spotted cDNA microarrays that use IMAGE clones of expressed sequence tags (ESTs). We found that a high proportion of these EST sequences contain 5′-end poly(dT) sequences that are remnants from the oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription of polyadenylated mRNA templates used to generate EST cDNA for sequence clone libraries. Analysis of expression data from two single-dye cDNA microarray experiments showed that ESTs whose sequences contain repeats of consecutive 5′-end dT residues appeared to be strongly coexpressed, while expression data of all other sequences exhibited no such pattern. Our analysis suggests that expression data from sequences containing 5′ poly(dT) tracts are more likely to be due to systematic cross-hybridization of these poly(dT) tracts than to true mRNA coexpression. This indicates that existing data generated by cDNA microarrays containing IMAGE clone ESTs should be filtered to remove expression data containing significant 5′ poly(dT) tracts.",

		"abstract": "Motivation: One approach to inferring genetic regulatory structure from microarray measurements of mRNA transcript hybridization is to\nestimate the associations of gene expression levels measured in\nrepeated samples. The associations may be estimated by\ncorrelation coefficients or by conditional frequencies (for\ndiscretized measurements) or by some other statistic. Although\nthese procedures have been successfully applied to other areas,\ntheir validity when applied to  microarray measurements has yet\nto be testedResults: This paper describes an elementary statistical difficulty for all such procedures, no matter whether based on Bayesian\nupdating, conditional independence testing, or other machine\nlearning procedures such as simulated annealing or neural net\npruning. The difficulty obtains if a number of cells from a\ncommon population are aggregated in a measurement of expression\nlevels. Although there are special cases where the conditional\nassociations are preserved under aggregation, in general\ninference of genetic regulatory structure based on conditional\nassociation is unwarrantedContact: tchu@andrew.cmu.edu*To whom correspondence should be addressed.",
