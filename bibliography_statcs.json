		"abstract": "We investigate the challenging task of learning causal structure in the presence of latent variables, including locating latent variables, determining their quantity, and identifying causal relationships among both latent and observed variables. To address this, we propose a Generalized Independent Noise (GIN) condition for linear non-Gaussian acyclic causal models that incorporate latent variables, which establishes the independence between a linear combination of certain measured variables and some other measured variables. Specifically, for two observed random vectors YY\\bf{Y} and ZZ\\bf{Z}, GIN holds if and only if ω⊺Yω⊺Y\\omega^{\\intercal}\\mathbf{Y} and ZZ\\mathbf{Z} are statistically independent, where ωω\\omega is a non-zero parameter vector determined by the cross-covariance between YY\\mathbf{Y} and ZZ\\mathbf{Z}. We then give necessary and sufficient graphical criteria of the GIN condition in linear non-Gaussian acyclic causal models. From a graphical perspective, roughly speaking, GIN implies the existence of a set S\\mathcal{S} such that S\\mathcal{S} is causally earlier (w.r.t. the causal ordering) than YY\\mathbf{Y}, and that every active (collider-free) path between YY\\mathbf{Y} and ZZ\\mathbf{Z} must contain a node from S\\mathcal{S}. Interestingly, we find that the independent noise condition (i.e., if there is no confounder, causes are independent of the residual derived from regressing the effect on the causes) can be seen as a special case of GIN. With such a connection between GIN and latent causal structures,  we further leverage the proposed GIN condition, together with a well-designed search procedure, to efficiently estimate Linear, Non-Gaussian Latent Hierarchical Models (LiNGLaHs), where latent confounders may also be causally related and may even follow a hierarchical structure.  We show that the underlying causal structure of a LiNGLaH is identifiable in light of GIN conditions under mild assumptions. Experimental results on both synthetic and three real-world data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

		"abstract": "In an essay recently published in this journal, Branden Fitelson argues that a variant of Miller's argument for the language dependence of the accuracy of predictions can be applied to Joyce's notion of accuracy of credences formulated in terms of scoring rules, resulting in a general potential problem for Joyce's argument for probabilism. We argue that no relevant problem of the sort Fitelson supposes arises since his main theorem and his supporting arguments presuppose the validity of nonlinear transformations of credence functions that Joyce's theory, charitably construed, would identify as invalid on the basis of the principle of simple dominance.",

De Bouvere provides criteria overlooked in Halvorson’s paper that are immune to his counterexamples and to the theorem he cites. Those criteria accord with a modest version of the semantic view that rejects some of Van Fraassen’s apparent claims while retaining the core of Patrick Suppes’s proposal.

Their results are disappointing: no method reliably finds and directs connections without large false negatives, large false positives, or both. Using multiple subject inputs, we apply a previously published search algorithm, IMaGES, and novel orientation algorithms, LOFS, in tandem to all of the simulations of DCM models described by Smith et al. (2011). We find that the procedures accurately identify effective connections in almost all of the conditions that Smith et al. simulated and, in most conditions, direct causal connections with precision greater than 90% and recall greater than 80%.",

		"abstract": "We consider several alternative ways of exploiting non-Gaussian distributional features, including some that can in principle identify direct, positive feedback relations (graphically, 2-cycles) and combinations of methods that can identify high dimensional graphs. All of the procedures are implemented in the TETRAD freeware (Ramsey et al., 2013). We show that in most cases the limited accuracy of the several non-Gaussian methods in the Smith et al. (2011) simulations can be attributed to the high-pass Butterworth filter used in that study. Without that filter, or with the filter in the widely used FSL program (Jenkinson et al., 2012), the directional accuracies of several of the non-Gaussian methods are at or near ceiling in many conditions of the Smith et al. simulation. We show that the improvement of an apparently Gaussian method (Patel et al., 2006) when filtering is removed is due to non-Gaussian features of that method introduced by the Smith et al. implementation. We also investigate some conditions in which multi-subject data help with causal structure identification using higher moments, notably with non-stationary time series or with 2-cycles. We illustrate the accuracy of the methods with more complex graphs with and without 2-cycles, and with a 500 node graph; to illustrate applicability and provide a further test we apply the methods to an empirical case for which aspects of the causal structure are known. Finally, we note a number of cautions and issues that remain to be investigated, and some outstanding problems for determining the structure of effective connections from fMRI data.",

In each case, a probabilistic relation between a theory and data is said to measure the power of an explanation, or degree of unification, or degree of coherence. This essay argues that the measures do not capture cases that are paradigms of scientific explanation, that the available psychological evidence indicates that the measures do not capture judgements of explanatory power, and, finally, that the measures do not provide useful methods for selecting hypotheses.",

		"abstract": "Neumann et al. (2010) aim to find directed graphical representations of the independence and dependence relations among activities in brain regions by applying a search procedure to merged fMRI activity records from a large number of contrasts obtained under a variety of conditions. To that end, Neumann et al., obtain three graphical models, justifying their search procedure with simulations that find that merging the data sampled from probability distributions characterized by two distinct Bayes net graphs results in a graphical object that combines the edges in the individual graphs. We argue that the graphical objects they obtain cannot be interpreted as representations of conditional independence and dependence relations among localized neural activities; specifically, directed edges and directed pathways in their graphical results may be artifacts of the manner in which separate studies are combined in the meta-analytic procedure. With a larger simulation study, we argue that their simulation results with combined data sets are an artifact of their choice of examples. We provide sufficient conditions and necessary conditions for the merger of two or more probability distributions, each characterized by the Markov equivalence class of a directed acyclic graph, to be describable by a Markov equivalence class whose edges are a union of those for the individual distributions. Contrary to Neumann et al., we argue that the scientific value of searches for network representations from imaging data lies in attempting to characterize large scaled neural mechanisms, and we suggest several alternative strategies for combining data from multiple experiments.",
